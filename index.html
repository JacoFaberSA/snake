        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <p>
          To move the snake swipe anywhere on the board in the direction you
          want the snake to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use your keyboard's arrow keys or w, a, s, d keys to move
          the snake in the desired direction.
        </p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          Collect as many apples as you can without running into the walls or
          the snake's own body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every apple you collect will increase the snake's length and the score
          by one.
        </p>
        <p>Your best score will be saved for the browser you are playing on.</p>

        <h2>Difficulty</h2>
        <p>As you collect more apples the snake will move faster.</p>

        <h2>Game Over</h2>
        <p>
          When the snake runs into the walls or its own body the game will end.
        </p>

        <h2>Restarting</h2>
        <p>
          To Restart the game click the pause button and then click Restart.
